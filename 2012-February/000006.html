<PRE>Hi all,

I've been thinking here (I know, that's dangerous :p) and I've got two 
suggestions:

1.
I've been thinking about the translation of X2Go into languages with 
less widespread usage (like Norwegian is because of the small population).
When someone gets an error message and he/she wants to search for more 
information on that error, they got less chance on finding any 
help/information because the text they search on is in a &quot;small&quot; (less 
used) language. Knowing what the text is in the original (English) 
language isn't possible/easy as the translation isn't done 
word-for-word, so the user can't search in English.
What I propose is to add an error-code/number which is the same 
regardless of the language used. If this could be something more than 
just a number, like &quot;[x2go-1234568]&quot; it would be real easy to find 
information with search engines. This would greatly improve the success 
rate in resolving any errors, and reduce the potential for frustration. 
A list, with the potential for translated versions, on the wiki could be 
kept updated with the error-code and a short helpful explanation/help text.

I really hope this can be considered for X2Go.

2.
In the original text (English) in the X2Go client the words &quot;suspend&quot; 
and &quot;resume&quot; gives the impression (at least for me) that the session is 
paused when suspended. I remember the early version of the NX libraries 
which actually paused the session when suspended, but that's a long time 
ago, and no longer the case. I therefore propose to use the words 
&quot;disconnect&quot; and &quot;reconnect&quot; instead, as this would more correct 
indicate the functionality that actually takes place.

Regards,

Terje
